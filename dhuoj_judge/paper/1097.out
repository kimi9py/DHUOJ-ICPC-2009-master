Now each player has exactly 25 cards. A round consists of several tricks. In the first trick, the dealer plays one or more cards (called "lead"), then, in clockwise order, players play the same number of cards as the first player one by one (called "follow"). The winner of the current trick leads cards during the next trick, and so on. If the winner of the current trick is a member of FT, then the FT gets the sum of the cards' pts played in this trick. 
Now we start to describe how to determine the winner of a trick. After the main suit and the CR of the current round are fixed, we can determine the "trumps" which are cards with main suit or CR (Current Rank), and the jokers. All other cards are "not-trumps".
